# Story About My Day
### Thursday Night
Yesterday night I got an email that my class this morning would be canceled. I decided to come in anyway to get some work done. Well, that was one of the reasons, the other reason is because I have a friend who takes the same bus as me on Fridays. It's nice to catch up with this friend because we don't go to the same school anymore and so we don't talk as much as we used to. 
### Friday Morning
Anyway I did get to school at a normal time, and I had 3 hours to burn until lunch. I spent the first two improving the code for my game. I wanted my NPC enemies to act more intelligently. I changed them so they use a ray cast to detect the player, so they know they should shoot. I also added some crash detection for their movement so they crash into each other less often. 
Then I decided to spend my last hour reading. I like to bring a book to school when I am bored. I find it hard to focus on reading at home so I like it when I get the opportunity to at school. The book I am reading currently is "The Perks of Being a Wallflower". This makes this whole assignment a little ironic because that book is told in a series of letters written to a mystery person, and it could be argued that very journal-like.
### Friday Lunch
Then I ate my lunch, it was pretty good and I'm quite happy with the butter chicken I made.
### Friday Afternoon
Then I did the class this assignment this is for. I've really started enjoying using the command line git for my projects.
Next, I'll probably go home, and I've planned to play some games with my partner so I have a feeling that will be fun
### Update
We ended up playing a game called "We Were Here: The Friendship" or something along those lines. The game was very fun and involved us solving different puzzles together asymetrically. In it's simplest form that would be one of us having the puzzle and the other having the answers. But this game had some very well designed puzzles that were tricky at times
