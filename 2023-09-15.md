Yestderday night I got an email that my class this morning would be canceled. I decided to come in anyway to get some work done. Well that was one of the reasons, the other reason is because I have a friend who takes the same bus as me on Fridays. It's nice to catch up with this friend because we don't go to the same school anymore and so we don't talk as much as we used to. 
Anyway I did get to school at a normal time, and I had 3 hours to burn until lunch. I spent the first two improving code for my game. I wanted my npc enemies to act in a more intelegent manor. I changed them so they use a raycast to detect the player, so they know they should shoot. I also added some crash detection for their movement so they crash into eachother less often. 
Then I decided to spend my last hour reading. I like to bring a book to school from when I am bored. I find it hard to focus on reading at home so I like it when I get the opportunity to at school. The book I am reading currently is "the perks of being a wallflower". This makes this whole assignment a little ironic because that book is told in a series of letters writtent to a mistery person, and it could be argued thats very journal like.
Then I ate my lunch, it was pretty good and im quite happy with the butter chicken I made.
Then I did the class this assignment this is for. I've really started enjoying using command line git for my projects.
Next I'll probably go home, and I've planned to play some games with my partener so I have a feeling thatwill be fun
