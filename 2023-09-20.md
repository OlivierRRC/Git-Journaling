### Morning
On Tuesday I woke up at my normal time. Once I woke up I rushed a little to get out of my house so as to not miss the bus like I almost had the day before. I got to the bus stop and waited a little while, it did come earlier than I was used to, so it was good that I rushed. When I got on the bus, I was expecting to go sit with my one friend who got on before I did. Looked around but didn't see her. I decided to text my other friend to ask if he knew if that one friend was supposed to be on the bus. He said that she said that it was going to be super late, but when I informed him that I was already on the bus, hijinx ensued. So I ended up taking the 65, my friend who was supposed to get on before me took the 67, and my other friend who I had texted caught the 66. Everything worked out in the end, but boy oh boy was that ever silly.
### Mid Day
Before class started, we got an email that Matt wouldn't be in to teach our class, so we got a nice work session. We did try to do a bit of playtesting and talk about our games as a class, but that was all self-directed. Then in the afternoon, I had Programming 1, where we were learning about object-oriented programming. I find it funny because it's a term I've heard so much without knowing what it means. It turns out that over my 5 or so years using Unity I've gotten a pretty intuitive sense of how it all works.
### After School
I took the bus home and that all went smoothly. Once I got home I didn't do too much of note; I did finish the show Andor which ended up being pretty good. I think despite being owned by Disney, this show had a lot to say about very progressive ideas such as abolishing prisons and workers' rights and the corruption of the upper class and how that relates to the corruption of government. All in all pretty good and stands on it's own without having seen Star Wars.
