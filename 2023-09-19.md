### Morning
On monday I woke up at the time I usually do to catch my bus. I take the 65 to school, and recently I've gotten used to it being a little later than what the shedule says. So I make my way to my bus stop. In order to get there I have to cross Roblin at what is possibly the worst excuse for pedestrian infrastructure, that being the sidewalk lowering to street level without so much as a sign to warn drivers that it is a cross walk, because I'm pretty sure it technically isn't. My gripes with pedestrian infastructure aside, half of my walk across roblin is made easy, because there's a semi truck turning left and blocking half the road. The other half of my walk is made more difficult because I can't see incoming traffic. I notice the bus rapidly aproaching my stop, which is a little odd because it's on time which is not when I'm expexcting it. So I take my chances and cross the street. I make it, and as I cross I wave the bus down because if I hadn't, I would have surley missed it. 
### Mid Day
At school nothing too eventfull happened. Math class is pretty fun so far, because it's always fun to learn a new programming language. After lunch I decided to walk to the bank, I had some money I wanted to deposit. I like going on adventures while relying on my sense of direction which I tend to boast about. So I looked up my destination on google maps, then put my phone away and walked in what I was pretty sure was the right direction. I made it there and back again without a hassle. And when I got back, I stayed till 4 to finish up my math work.
### After School
My after school Wasn't All too evenfull. I watched more Andor and I'm liking it more, and I went scrounging for some sounds to put in my game studio project. Then I eventually went to bed.
