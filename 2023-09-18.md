# My Weekend
## Saturday
### Wakeup
On Saturday I woke up probably later than I should have (despite a dozen alarms I had set), that being around 11 I think. I try to wake up earlier, but I've always had problems with that, so 11 really isn't that bad compared to what it's been in the past. I probably stayed in bed a little after I woke up and watched some YouTube to get me going.
### Start of Day
I watched some of the Star Wars show Andor. I've never really seen much Star Wars but I heard this show is good and stands on its own, so I thought I'd give it a try. It's definitely a good show, though not the best I've seen, and I'm sure I'd like it more if I was more of a Star Wars guy.
### Leaving the House
I wanted to go see my partner later that day, and my dad was going to drive me because they live somewhat near a Costco and my dad wanted to go shopping there.
### Costco
Costo was a nightmare, too many people: 0/10.
### Chapters
We went to chapters after Costco because we had some time to burn. I looked at a few books that interest me, but the one I really want is currently only available in hardcover. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, I just prefer a soft cover for ergonomic reasons, and I do have a couple other books on my reading list, so I'm good to wait for this one.
### Time with Partner
They showed me a cool guitar pedal they found in their basement. Supposedly it used to belong to one of the members of the Who. Some of the settings on the pedal would just make noise, and some wouldn't make a sound at all, so I think we might not have been using it right. Then we watched the movie Pitch Perfect 2 because we had watched the first one the previous weekend. It's not a very good movie, but it is entertaining so I can't complain too much. We also watched Hotel Transylvania 2 which was fun because it's generally a pretty good movie franchise.
### End of Day
I got home and went to bed.
## Sunday
### Wakeup
Sunday was a lot less eventful, I again woke up around 11. Which was fine.
### Start of Day
I watched more Andor, as well as a fair amount of YouTube content.
### Cooking
The main thing I've been doing on Sundays since school started is cooking something for my lunch for the week ahead. So this weekend my mom ordered one of those meal order boxes, and I made Korean-style chicken. I'm not sure how it tastes yet, but I have a feeling it'll be good.
### End of Day
Cooking took a fair amount of time, and afterwards, I really didn't do anything eventful, so when it got late I eventually made my way to bed.
### Update
The food I made tastes really good, I really quite like the rice. Ususally I make basmati rice because that's what I have at home, but for this recipie I had jasmin rice which is a little bit stickier and I like that more.
