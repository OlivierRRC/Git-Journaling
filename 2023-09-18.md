# My Weekend
## Saturday
### Wakeup
On saturday I woke up probably later than I should have (despite a dozen alarms I had set), that being around 11 I think. I try to wake up earlier, but I've always had problems with that, so 11 really isn't that bad compared to what it's been in the past. I probably stayed in bed a little after I woke up and watched some youtube to get me going.
### Start of Day
I watched some of the starwars show Andor. I've never really seen much starwars but I heard this show is good and stands on it's own, so I tought I'd give it a try. It's definitley a good show, though not the best i've seen, and I'm sure I'd like it more if I was more of a starwars guy.
### Leaving the House
I wanted to go see my partner later that day, and my dad was going to drive me because they live somewhat near a costco and my dad wanted to go shopping there.
### Costco
Costo was a nightmare, too many people: 0/10.
### Chapters
We went to chapeters after costco because we had some time to burn. I looked at a few books that interest me, but the one I really want is currently only available in hardcover. There's nothing inhently wrong with that, I just preffer a soft cover for ergonomic reasons, and I do have a couple other books on my reading list, so I'm good to wait for this one.
### Time with Partner
They showed me a cool guitar peddal they found in their basement. Supposedly it used to belong to one of the members of the who. Some of the seetings on the peddal would just make noise, and some wouldnt make a sound at all, so i think we might not have been using it right. Then we watched the movie pitch perfect 2 because we has watched the first one the previous weekend. It's not a very good movie, but it is entertaing so i can't complain too much. We also watch hotel transylvania 2 which was fun because its generally a pretty good movie franchise.
### End of Day
I got home and went to bed.
## Sunday
### Wakeup
Sunday was a lot less eventfull, I again woke up around 11. Which was fine.
### Start of Day
I watched more Andor, aswell as a fair amount of youtube content.
### Cooking
The main thing i've been doing on Sundays since school started is cooking something for my lunch for the week ahead. So this weekend my mom ordered one of those meal order boxes, and I made Korean style chicken. I'm not sure how it tasetes yet, but I have a feeling it'll be good.
### End of Day
Cooking took a fair amount of time, and afterwords I really didn't do anything eventfull, so when it got late i eventually made my way to bed.
